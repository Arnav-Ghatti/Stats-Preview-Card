## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt blending modes in css which I didn't even know existed. I also learnt about media queries for the responsiveness of the website

```css
.overlay {
    width: 550px;
    height: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    background-color: #aa5cdbb3;
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Blend Modes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c94pr41jaI) - Helped me in adding the overlay effect over the image.

## Acknowledgments

NOTE: The code under the media queries in style.css is really messy and i didn't clean it up becuase I was tired and didn't want, please bear with me.
